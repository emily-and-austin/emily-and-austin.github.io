				<h1> It's the story of us </h1>

				<img class="sketch" src="./Images/boySketch.jpg"/>
				<p>
					There once was a young, nerdy boy. He loved math and school and really just a bunch of dorky things.
				</p>

				<p>
					He loved video games and coding and computers and board games and mechanical keyboard...
				</p>

				<p>
					But what he loved more than all of that, was to sing!
				</p>

				<img class="sketch" src="./Images/girlSketch.jpg"/>
				<p>
					And across the country was a beautiful, smart, kind-spirited girl. 
				</p>
				<p>
					She was like 5 years older than him, but don't worry, we'll fast forward in time a bit so this doesn't get creepy.
				</p>
				<p>
					She had a passion for work and people and always doing the right things to make others feel loved and make the world a better place.
				</p>
				<img class="purdue-sketch" src="./Images/PurdueSketch.jpg"/>
				<p>
					As they both searched for their dreams, they ended up heading to the same place, Purdue University, which is both a world-class institution for higher learning, and a world class panhandler constantly begging for more of your money.
				</p>

				<p>
					But they both were missing something.
				</p>

				<p>
					The girl was missing somebody to share her love, her laughter, and her passion with.
				</p>

				<p>
					And the boy was missing somebody to share his music with.
				</p>
				<img class="sketch" src="./Images/statisticsSketch.png" />
				<p>
					It turns out that these two people full of joy and hope and love would meet in one of the most boring places in the world.
				</p>
				<p>
					Statistics Class.
				</p>
				<p>
					And not just any Statistics Class. This one was extra dry and boring. And had a professor that didn't care. Or when he did care it was about things totally unrelated to the course material and impossible to find any useful knowledge purpose for *cough* sweep operator *cough*
				</p>

				<p>
					But maybe it was that boredom and dryness that attracted them together. Maybe that's the kind of place where their brightness, happiness, and love couldn't help but stand out.
				</p>
				<img class="sketch" src="./Images/classroom.png" />
				<p>
					One day, the class had a big, important project and everyone had to pick groups.
				</p>
				<p>
					Everyone started grouping off one by one, but the boy sat alone in the back of the classroom.
				</p>
				<p>
					"Hey you!" the girl said.
				</p>				
				<p>
					The boy looked around confused. "Who? Me??" he said in reply.
				</p>
				<p>
					"Yeah you! Who else do you think I'm talking to back there. Come join our group," she said playfully. And so he did.
				</p>
				<img class="sketch" src="./Images/studentsSketch.jpg" />
				<p>
					They worked together and they worked together and they worked together. They wanted to get their big project just right. And so they spent more and more time around each other. And they both thought "Hey! This person is great! But I don't know that we could ever be together."
				</p>
				<p>
					The girl thought the boy was just too young. It couldn't possibly work out.
				</p>
				<p>
					The boy thought the girl was just too pretty and smart. She would never go for a boy like him.
				</p>
				<p>
					But as they kept working together, they knew they couldn't keep away from each other. So the boy decided to take a risk. He did what he had always wanted to do and shared his music with someone special.
				</p>
				<img class="sketch" src="./Images/recording.jpg" />
				<p>
					After they had finished with the class, the boy left the girl a recording of a song. He sang, "You are so beautiful to me!"
				</p>
				<p>
					The girl didn't know what to do. At first she thought, "I can't say yes. It just could never work." But she slowly kept coming back.
				</p>
				<p>
					The boy made one final shot. He was singing in a concert and he asked the girl to come. And after much thought and deliberation, she did.
				</p>
				<p>
					The boy sang and sang his heart out, knowing that the girl he was falling for was sitting out in the darkness in front of him. And the girl listened. And she felt his love there too.
				</p>
				<img class="sketch" src="./Images/boyGirlCouch.jpg" />
				<p>
					When they met after the show, they knew. They both couldn't be without the other. They went back home. They watched some TV. They held hands. They had gummy bears. 
				</p>
				<p>
					They kissed.
				</p>
				<p>
					And they accepted that they were falling in love.
				</p>
				<p>
					And from that day on, their love has only grown stronger. They've given their happiness, sadness, joys, frustrations... their everything to each other.
				</p>
				<img class="sketch" src="./Images/wedding.jpg" />
				<p>
					They love each other. They will for the rest of their lives
